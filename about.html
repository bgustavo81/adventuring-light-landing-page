            <!-- <h3>Follow me underground!</h3> -->
            <p>
              How I became a caver: In 2017, after enduring a very challenging season of life, I found myself standing at a crossroads with 8 weeks of summer ahead of me before starting the job I’d been hoping for. With finances too tight for a traditional vacation, I decided to embark on a unique adventure with my kids: we would visit every waterfall in the state of Alabama. Little did I know this ambitious goal would prove impossible, but what an incredible journey it turned out to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              We managed to see over 100 waterfalls that summer, documenting our adventures on social media along the way. Our posts began to attract attention, with people reaching out to ask about our trips. Inspired by this growing interest, I started a website and Facebook page to share our experiences, offering inspiration and practical directions for others looking to explore the outdoors.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we hunted for waterfalls we hadn’t yet visited, I stumbled upon a discovery that would forever change the course of my life. Just two hours from my home was a place so stunning, so otherworldly, I could hardly believe it existed. That place was Stephens Gap, a cave with a breathtaking waterfall cascading into its depths, illuminated by ethereal light rays that seemed to come from heaven itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasted no time. I applied for a permit, enlisted a friend to join me, and off we went. The experience was transformative. I was captivated by the beauty and serenity of the cave and couldn’t wait to share it with others. On our next trip, I brought my husband and two friends along, adding another permit for Tumbling Rock, an additional cave managed by the Southeastern Cave Conservancy, Inc. (SCCi).
            </p>
            <p>
              At Tumbling Rock, we noticed a group of people emerging from the cave. They were covered head to toe in mud, wearing helmets, headlamps, sturdy boots, and full-body protective suits. By contrast, our group—four educated individuals, one of whom is a medical doctor—stood out starkly. We wore shorts, tank tops, and cute tennis shoes. Our “gear” consisted of two headlamps and a few cell phone flashlights. Helmets? What were those?
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, I’m sure the waiver we signed mentioned something about proper equipment and preparation. But, caught up in the excitement, we charged ahead into the darkness. The cave was thrilling and cold, its rugged beauty undeniable. However, after about 45 minutes of climbing, careful walking, and sliding down slopes, one of our headlamps gave out. The limitations of our inadequate lighting and lack of preparation became glaringly clear. Cold and humbled, we retraced our steps and made our way out of the cave, vowing to come back better equipped.
            </p>
            <p>
              That experience was a wake-up call. Determined to do things right, I found a local caving club and attended a meeting. 
            </p>
            <p>
              That was the beginning of a new chapter. From then on, I embraced caving as a passion, immersing myself in the adventure, education, and community it offered. The journey that began with chasing waterfalls had led me underground to a whole new world, one with beauty and adventure unmatched, and I couldn’t be more grateful for where it has taken me.

              <h3>Gear</h3>
              <p>At the very least you will need a helmet headlamp and 2 sources of backup lighting, a bag to carry these things, knee pads and clothes that can get dirty. You’ll also need a slip resistant pair of shoes. My recommendations for these things can be found in this video: </p>
